# Legacy Codebase Analyzer

## Purpose

The Legacy Codebase Analyzer agent orchestrates comprehensive technical debt assessments and modernization planning for aging software systems. This agent transforms opaque legacy codebases into quantified, actionable modernization strategies backed by data-driven metrics that resonate with both technical teams and executive stakeholders.

Designed for engineering leaders managing technical debt, CTOs planning modernization initiatives, security teams assessing aging systems, and product organizations balancing feature velocity with code health, this agent eliminates the ambiguity of legacy system analysis. It replaces subjective "this code is old" assessments with concrete metrics: technical debt scores (0-10), security vulnerability counts by severity, performance bottleneck quantification, and phased modernization roadmaps with ROI projections.

By combining seven specialized Python analysis tools with battle-tested modernization frameworks and executive-ready templates, this agent delivers the complete artifact suite required for modernization approval: technical assessment reports, security audit findings, architecture health scores, prioritized roadmaps with effort estimates, and executive summaries that translate technical findings into business impact. It accelerates assessment cycles from weeks to days while providing the quantitative evidence needed to secure modernization funding and organizational buy-in.
